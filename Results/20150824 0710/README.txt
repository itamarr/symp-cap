This results folder contains data files of a script that calculated capacities of random non-degenerate simplices, i.e. their vertices are generated by the rand function.
Besides the workspace and the log file, there's a a csv file containing 5x4 tables representing simplices, followed by a row with the following structure:
c,v,udot

where c is the capacity of the simplex, v is (c/(vol(simplex)^(1/n))), and udot is the vector of the derivatives of the minimizer of the dual action (returned from the Capacity function).
