The file in this folder contains the capacities of simplices with these vertices:
v0 = [0 0 0 0]
v1 = [1 0 0 0]
v2 = [0 1 a 0]
v3 = [0 0 b 1]
v4 = [0 1 1 1]
Where the coordinates are: p1,p2,q1,q2, and a and b run along -5 to 5 with steps of 0.5.

To analyze the results, run either bars_generation.m or AnalyzeResultsScript.m.
