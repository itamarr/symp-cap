			Computational Symplectic Capacities

		About the Project
	</h2>
		
	<p>
				
			In May 2015 a group of graduate students gathered for the Computational Symplectic Topology Workshop's 
			<a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~ostrover/Workshop/CST/Workshop-CST.html">first seat</a>, 
			in which they started work on the symplectic capacities project.
			The goal of this project was to come up with, and implement, an algorithm to calculate a symplectic invariant called symplectic capacity, 
			specifically the symplectic capacity called Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity.
			<br/>
			Once this was achieved, the team went on to use this computational tool and pursue with ambition to supply numerical evidence to some
			famous long standing conjectures regarding this invariant, such as Viterbo's conjecture, which is detailed in the 
			<a href="#theoretical_background">
			background</a> 
			section
			 of this site; 
			and moreover, attempt to demystify several aspect of the behaviour of the capcity function.
	</p>
	<p>
			This website is meant to succinctly explain about the project and its results. For the interested reader, a document with further details is being prepared.
			<br/><br/>
			The implementation of the project is written in MATLAB, and its code is based 
			<a href="http://github.com/itamarr/symp-cap">here</a> (github), icluding test results.
			<br/>

	<span class="sec_title">Symplectic manifolds and symplectic capacities</span>
	<p>
		A <span class="defn">symplectic manifold</span> $(M,\om)$ is a smooth manifold $M$ equipped with a closed non-degenerate 2-form $\om$, called a symplectic form.
		A first example would be the standard symplectic vector space $\R^{2n}$, with coordinates $q_1, \ldots, q_n, p_1,\ldots, p_n$, equipped with the standard symplectic form $\om_0 = \sum_{i=1}^n dp_i \wedge dq_i$.
		Locally, by Darboux theorem, any symplectic manifold looks like the standard $(\R^{2n},\om_0)$. 
		Thus, there are no local invariants in symplectic geometry, as opposed to the situation in Riemannian geometry.
		However, numerical global invariants do exist, symplectic capacities are a significant example of such invariants.
		We deal with symplectic capacities of submanifolds of $\R ^{2n}$ equipped with the standard symplectic form, so we'll only describe this case.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We use the following notations:
		<ul>
			<li>
				$B_{2n}(r) = \{ x\in \R^{2n} \ |\  \|x\| < r \}$  the open ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin,
				and
			</li>
			<li>
				$Z_{2n}(r) = \{ x\in \R^{2n} : q_1^2 + p_1^2 < r^2 \} = B_2(r) \times \R^{2(n-1)}$, a cylinder.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
		<div class="definition">
			A <span class="defn">symplectic capacity</span> on $\R^{2n}$ is a function $c$ defined on open subsets of $\R^{2n}$, taking non-negative values, with the following properties:
			<ul class="numbered">
				<li>(Monotonicity) If $U \subset V$, then $c(U) \leq c(V)$, </li>
				<li>(Invariance) If $\vphi$ is a symplectomorphism, then $c(\vphi(U)) = c(U)$,</li>
				<li>(Homogeneity) For all $\alpha > 0$, $c(\alpha U) = \alpha^2 c(U)$,</li>
				<li>(Non-triviality) $c (B_{2n}(1)) > 0$ and $c(Z_{2n}(1)) < \infty$.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		A symplectic capacity $c$ is said to be <span class="defn">normalized</span>, if $c (B_{2n}(1)) = c(Z_{2n}(1)) = \pi $.
	<br/>
	
		It is a-priori unclear whether a symplectic capacity exists, but currently there is already a list of capacities introduced in various ways.
		The concept was introduced by I. Ekeland amd H. Hofer in 1990, although, in fact, the first symplectic capacity (the symplectic width) was constructed by M. Gromov, related to the Non-Squeezing theorem he proved in 1985.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The project focuses on a certain capacity, called the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity, $c_{EHZ}$.
		It is a normalized symplectic capacity defined on compact convex subsets of $\R^{2n}$, as will be shortly given.
		<br/>
		Let $K$ be a compact strictly convex set in $\R^{2n}$, such that $0$ is in the interior of $K$ and the boundary $\de K$ is smooth of class $C^2$.
		Denote $H(x) = \| x \|_K^2$, where $\| x \|_K = inf \{ \lambda>0 : x \in \lambda K \} $ is the semi-norm with respect to the convex body $K$.
		(It is a semi-norm in the sense that it is only positively homogeneous, since $K$ might not be symmetric; Being a semi-norm would be enough for our purposes). 
	
		By definition, $K = \{ x\in \R^{2n} : \|x\|_K \leq 1 \}$ and $\de K = H^{-1} (1)$.
		Note also that the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H = J \nabla H$ defines a flow on $\de K$.
		<br/>
		
		Consider the space of periodic orbits of $X_H$,
		\begin{equation}
  			\calE_K = \left\{ z \in C^2(\R,\de K) : \dot z = X_H\circ z,\ z(0)=z(T) \text{ for some }T>0\right\} \;.
  			\label{eq:def_space_of_periodic_orbits}
		\end{equation}
		
		<div class="definition">
			The <span class="defn">action</span> of an orbit $z \in \calE_K$ with period $T$ is
			$\calA (z) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^T \left<-J\dot z,z\right> dt \;.$
		</div>
		
		<div class="definition">
			The <span class="defn">Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity</span> of $K$ is the quantity
			\begin{equation}
				c_{EHZ} (K) = \inf \left\{  \calA (z) : z \in \calE _K  \right\} \;.
				\label{eq:def_EHZ_capacity}
			\end{equation}
		</div>
		
		We denote by $\calK$ the set of all compact strictly convex subsets of $\R^{2n}$ which have $C^2$ boundary.
		
		<div class="theorem">
		 	The functional $c_{EHZ}$ is a capacity on $\calK$.
		</div>

		For computation purposes we use the next result.
		<div class="theorem">
			For a convex body $K$ containing $0$, it holds that
			\begin{equation}
				c_{EHZ}(K)=\min_{z\in\mathcal{E}}\frac{\pi}{2}\int_0^{2\pi}h_K^2(\dot{z}(t))dt,
			\end{equation}
			where
			\begin{equation}
				\mathcal{E}=\left\{z\in W^{1,2}(\mathbb{S}^1,\mathbb{R}) \Bigg\vert \int_0^{2\pi}z(t)dt=0, \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{2\pi}\langle Jz,\dot{z}\rangle=1\right\},
			\end{equation}
			and $h_K(v)=\lVert v\rVert_{K^\circ}$.
		</div>
	</p>
	
	<span class="sec_title">Capacities - Known Values and Known Conjectures</span>
	<p>
		It is well known that in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ all capacities coincide with the 2-dimensional volume, or simply put - area. Quite understandably the 2 dimensional case have been crucial to testing that the algorithm works.
			- In the plane (or state it before as an explanation?)
			
			- Ellipsoids (from [HZ])
			
			- Yoav's
			
			
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
		To establish a connection between capacities and the approach of Riemannian geometry, one can ask about the relations between capacity and volume. Some of these questions are in the taste of the isoperimetric inequality.
	</p>
	<p>
		Claude Viterbo has conjectured that among all convex bodies in $\R^{2n}$ of a given volume, the Euclidean ball has maximal symplectic capacity. 

		To be precise, consider the following relation between the a capacity $c$ of a (convex) set $K$ and the unit ball in $\R^{2n}$
		\begin{equation} 
			\frac{c(K)}{c\left( B_{2n} \right)} 
				\leq 
			\gamma_n \left( \frac{Vol (K) }{Vol (B_{2n})} \right) ^{1/n} \;,
			\label{viterbo_ineq_expression}
		\end{equation}
		
		where the constant $\gamma_n$ is of interest.
		We therefore considered the following conjecture for the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity.
	</p>
		
		
		<div class="conjecture"> (Viterbo's conjecture)
			The best constant in (\ref{viterbo_ineq_expression}) is $\gamma_n = 1$, for any choice of convex body $K$ and any capacity.
		</div>
	<p>
		Another known question is the following.
		<div class="conjecture"> (The subadditivity conjecture)
			If a convex body $K \subset \R^{2n}$ is covered by a finite set of convex bodies $\{ K_i \}$
			the for a symplectic capacity $c$, 
			\begin{equation}
				c(K) \leq \sum_i c(K_i) \;,
			\end{equation}
		</div>
	</p>
	<p>		
		Additionally, in the spirit of convex geometry, the following statement was suggested to be tested by Y. Ostrover.
		It is known that for any convex body $K$, such that $-K\subset nK$ and its barycenter at $0$, it holds that,
			\begin{equation}
				c_{EHZ}(K-K)\leq (2n+1) c_{EHZ}(K).
			\end{equation}
		Thus, it makes sense to ask whether or not the following conjecture holds true.
		<div class="conjecture">
			\begin{equation}
				c_{EHZ}(K-K) \leq \mathtt{const}\cdot c_{EHZ}(K)
			\end{equation}
			for some <font face="courier"><b>const</b></font> independent of the dimension.
		</div>
	</p>
	<p>
		As part of the project, we tried to design and run tests for these famous conjectures. They are detailed in the document being prepared.
	</p>

	<span class="sec_title">Towards computations - discretization </span>
	<p>
				As mentioned before, we want to solve the following minimization problem, being a minimization problem equivalent to our initial one.
				We consider the set
					\begin{equation}
						M = \left\{ x\in H^{1}([0,1],\R^{2n})\,:\, \int_0^1 \dot x(t)dt = 0\right\}
					\end{equation}
					
				and the functional 
					\begin{equation}
						\calF_K(x) = \int_0^1h_K^2(-J\dot x(t))dt \;.
						\label{eq:functional}
					\end{equation}
					
				Our minimization problem is the following constrained one:
					\begin{equation}
						\lambda = \inf\left\{ \calF_K(x) : \, x\in M,\, \int_0^1\langle -J\dot x(t),x(t)\rangle dt = 1\right\}
						\label{MinProblem}
					\end{equation}
				We know that it has at least one solution, denoted by $u$. 
				
	</p>
	
	<p>			
				
				In order to numerically solve the minimization problem (\ref{MinProblem}), 
				we follow the general lines of the discretized problem presented in <a href="#GJ+">[GJ+]</a>.
				<br/>
			
				
				Given $m\in\N$, divide the interval $[0,1]$ to $m$ subintervals 
					$I_{m,k}:=(\frac{k}{m},\frac{k+1}{m})$, $k=0,\dots,m-1$, of length $\frac{1}{m}$, 
				and consider only $H^1$-functions that are linear on each subinterval,
				
				\begin{equation}
					W_m:=\left\{u\in H^1([0,1],\R^{2n})\ \big|\ \dot u|_{I_{m,k}} \text{ is constant},
					\ \int_0^1u(t)dt=0,\ \int_0^1\left<-J\dot u,u\right>=1 \right\},
				\end{equation}
				
				where $J\in\Mat(2n,\R)$ is the standard complex structure on $\R^{2n}$,
				
				\begin{equation*}
					J= \left(\begin{array}{cc}
						0 & I_n\\ -I_n & 0
						\end{array}\right).
				\end{equation*}
				
				Let $u\in W_m$, then $\dot u$ is piece-wise constant, and can be represented by a vector 
				$\dot \x= (\dot x_1,\dots,\dot x_{m})\in \R^{2n\cdot m}$. In this case, the functional to minimize (\ref{eq:functional}) takes the form
				
				\begin{equation}
					F(\dot\x) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^{m} G(-J \dot x_j),
				\end{equation}
				
				and its gradient is
				\begin{equation}
					\nabla F (\dot\x) = \frac{1}{m} (J\nabla G(-J\dot x_1),\dots,J\nabla G(-J\dot x_{m})).
				\end{equation}
				
				The constraints are given by
				\begin{eqnarray}
					0 &=& \ell(\dot\x) = \sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\dot x_j, \label{eq:lincon}\\
					0 &=& q(\dot\x) = \frac{1}{m^2} \sum_{k=1}^{m-1}\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\left<-J \dot x_k, \dot x_j\right> -1 = \frac{1}{m^2} \dot \x^T A \dot \x -1,\label{eq:quadcon}
				\end{eqnarray}
				
				where 
				
				\begin{equation*}
					A:=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
						0_{2n} & -J_{2n} & \cdots & -J_{2n}\\
						\vdots & \ddots & & \vdots\\
						\vdots & & \ddots & -J_{2n}\\
						0_{2n} & \cdots & \cdots & 0_{2n}
					\end{array}\right) \in \Mat(\R, 2n\cdot m),
				\end{equation*}

				and the gradient of the quadratic constraint is 
				\begin{equation*}
					\nabla q(\dot\x) = \frac{1}{m^2} (A+A^T)\dot \x.
				\end{equation*}
				
				To minimize the functional $F$ under the constraints $\ell,q$ we use the Matlab library function named 
				"<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fmincon.html">fmincon</a>. 
				This function receives as input the functional, its gradient, the constraints and their gradients, 
				together with a starting point in  $\R^{2n\cdot m}$ and iteratively searches for a local minimum. 
				The function "fmincon" enables to choose a minimization algorithm out of a given list. 
				After numerically experimenting the possible algorithms, we chose "active-set" as it produced the best results in terms of accuracy and run-time. 
				To choose a starting vector, we randomly pick a vector in $\R^{2n\cdot m}$, 
				then shift and rescale it to satisfy conditions (\ref{eq:lincon}), (\ref{eq:quadcon}).

		The Algorithm
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		The project contains several sub-modules, each with its own computational purpose, yet all of them use the basic function called Capacity which calculates the capacity of a given polytope. In this section we explain the algorithm of this function which relies on the discretization presented in A. G&ouml;ing-Jaeschke's PhD thesis <a href="#GJ+">[GJ+]</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		We present the algorithm, with modifications, here:

</pre>

	<p>
	Let's explain some of the points in the algorithm. First, this is the general form of the algorithm, in the sense that it's agnostic to the question of "what type  of convex body (e.g. ellipsoids, simplices, etc.) are we considering?". It is known that one can approximate a convex body by polytopes, and that approximation translates to capacities. Yet, this requires proof (see the theoretical section), and further, this approach takes a heavy toll in terms of running time. In cases where the norm of the dual body is known analytically, the algorithm is much more precise and takes far less time.
	</p>

	<p>
	With this in mind, we'll continue with polytopes as a prime example. The input of the algorithm, therefore, is a matrix $P$ whose rows are the extreme points of the convex hull for which we want to calculate the capacity. Therefore, the dimensions of $P$ is $k\times 2n$ where $k$ is the number of points and $2n$ is the dimension of the ambient euclidean space.
	</p>

	<p>
We begin by centralizing the polytope, so to increase the accuracy of the action function. Recall that the Hamiltonian is the norm of the convex body, whence we need the centroid of the convex body to be at 0. We then generate a random starting path in the dual space.
This path is represented by constant vectors, as explained in the theoretical section of this site. We then fix the path so that it closes to a closed path, and then calculate the constraint function on this path, i.e., $x^TA_{2n}x$. We continue generating such random paths until we reach one whose constraint value is not too small, since we later normalize by this value and would like to avoid loss of significance due to small numbers division. Finally for this part of the algorithm, we check if the constraint value is negative, since this indicates the path is going in the wrong direction, in which case we fix by reversing the order of the vertices.
	</p>
	<p>
For the action minimizing section of the algorithm, note that we iterate the minimization process a few times (the stopping conditions for this are configurable parameters of the algorithm). The idea behind this procedure is to begin with a rough approximation of the action, and then fine tune this value until we don't produce further meaningful improvements. The reason we do this is to improve the running time of the algorithm, and at least empirically this produced satisfying results. Note that we have no proof that this phenomenon holds true in all cases.
	</p>

	<p>
The procedure of iteration consists in both increasing the number of subintervals, thus allowing finer paths; and in increasing the tolerance values for the <font face="courier"><b>fmincon</b></font> function. Some of these values are configurable, and generally have been tested to produce better running time.
	</p>

	<p>
For completeness we remind the reader that the function to minimize is given by
\begin{equation}
		F(x)=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}G(-J_{2n}x_j),
\end{equation}
where $x_j$ is the derivative of the characteristic in the interval $I_j$. Note that in $G$ is where a change of the convex body, e.g. from polytope to ellipsoid, affects the implementation. The linear constraints supplied to <font face="courier"><b>fmincon</b></font> is the discretized version of the constraint $\int_0^1\tilde{u}\operatorname{d}t=0$, namely,
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}x_j=0,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{u}$ is the piecewise constant derivatives. The nonlinear constraints supplied to <font face="courier"><b>fmincon</b></font> is given by the function
\begin{equation}
	c(x)=\frac{1}{m^2}x^TA_{2n}x-1
\end{equation}
	</p>
	<p>
A final remark on the minimization, is that the algorithm we use in <font face="courier"><b>fmincon</b></font> is called 'active set'. This choice was made after several attempts to find the most suitable of algorithms, during which all others gave worse results - either in running time or in numerical result.
	</p>
	<p>
The last non-trivial step in the Capacity function is to reconstruct the characteristic out of the minimizer of the dual problem.
Theoretically this is achieved by integration, and so the implementation of the <font face="courier">ReconstructCharacteristic</font> function simply consists of summing of the correct terms in the right factors.
	</p>

	<p>

We ran different tests, attempting to better understand the behaviour of the capacity function, and to test the correctness of some conjectures.
	</p>
<span class="sec_title">Capacity of a ball</span>
	<p>
One of the basic convex bodies is a ball, and since the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity is normalized, we know that we should be getting $\pi$.
To calculate the capacity of a ball one can either consider the ball as an epllipsoid whose radii are all 1, or one can approximate via polytopes.
Here we'll discuss approximation by polytopes, see later section about  <a href="#ellipsoid_capacity">ellipsoids</a>.
In 2 dimensions, we approximate the disc by regular polygons, and indeed we see that as the number of vertices increases, so does the result approaches $\pi$.

Here is a scatter plot of the characteristic reconstructed for the regular polygon with 40 points:

In higher dimensions, we approximate by using random points in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and normalizing them to sit on the unit sphere.
For $n=2$ we received the following results:

It appears that the number of points required to approximate the unit ball's capacity increases dramatically with the dimension.
Furthermore, the difference in running time is quite noticable.

Compare this to the 2-dimensional case, i.e., $n=1$:

	In the case of 50 points, the characteristic also seems to be visibly different than the circle, but quite close to it.<br/></br>

Running the Capacity function on $l_p$ unit balls, denoted by $B_p^n(1)$ where $n$ is the dimension, yields the following results when approximating them with 50 random points scaled by the appropriate norm.

	<p>
Of course, as in the case of Euclidean balls, the norms are known analytically, whence we could write a version of the Capacity function that handles $l_p$ balls specifically.
However, this has not been done.

	<span class="sec_title">Capacity of the standard simplex</span>

The standard simplex for us is the simplex whose vertices are 0 and the unit vectors.
The capacity of the standard simplex has been computed in <a href="#N">[N]</a> to be $\frac{1}{2n}$ where $2n$ is the dimension of the ambient space.

Our capacity function gave the following results:

	<span class="sec_title" id="ellipsoid_capacity">Capacity of Ellipsoids</span>
	<p>
Given an ellipsoid $\mathcal{E}$, one can change the base of the space and arrive at the next representation of the ellipsoid:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{E}=\left\{x\in\mathbb{R}\Bigg\vert \sum_{j=1}^{n}\frac{1}{r_j^2}(x_{e_j}^2+x_{f_j}^2)\leq 1\right\}.
\end{equation}
Where here we assumed the symplectic basis is given by $e_1,\ldots,e_n,f_1,\ldots,f_n$, and $x_{e_j}$ is the $e_j$'th coordinate of $x$.
Further, the numbers $r_1,\ldots,r_n$ are ordered, and denoted, like so $0<r_1(\mathcal{(E)})\leq\ldots\leq r_n(\mathcal{E})$.
These are symplectic invariants of $\mathcal{E}$, called the symplectic radii, and in fact it's known that,
\begin{equation}
	c(\mathcal{E})=\pi r_1(\mathcal{E})^2
\end{equation}
for any weakly nontrivial symplectic capacity $c$ on the class of symplectic manifolds.
For further details see <a href="HZ">[HZ]</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
Therefore, we implemented a version of the Capacity function that calculates the capacity of ellipsoids, given in symplectic form.
That is, the input for this version of the function receives a vector of symplectic radii as input, and finds its capacity using the general algorithm described <a href="#algorithm">here</a>.
	</p>
<span class="sub_sec_title">Example 1</span>
	<p>
As mentioned above, the euclidean ball is just an ellipsoid whose radii are all 1. We therefore expect the Capacity function to yield a value close to $\pi$ for a radii vector given by [1 ... 1]. This is indeed the case:

<span class="sub_sec_title">Example 2</span>
	<p>
		In this example we show the results of the Capacity function for a couple of ellipsoids. Note that they are of dimension twice the number of radii. Further, note that although our implementation can find the capacity of ellipsoids already given in symplectic form, the order of the radii makes no difference.
