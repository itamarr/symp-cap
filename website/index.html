	<p>
				
			In May 2015 a group of graduate students gathered for the Computational Symplectic Topology Workshop's 
			<a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~ostrover/Workshop/CST/Workshop-CST.html">first seat</a>, 
			in which they started work on the symplectic capacities project.
			The goal of this project was to come up with, and implement, an algorithm to calculate a symplectic invariant called symplectic capacity, 
			specifically the symplectic capacity called Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity.
			<br/>
			Once this was achieved, the team went on to use this computational tool and pursue with ambition to supply numerical evidence to some
			famous long standing conjectures regarding this invariant, such as Viterbo's conjecture, which is detailed in the 
			<a href="#theoretical_background">
			background</a> 
			section
			 of this site; 
			and moreover, attempt to demystify several aspect of the behaviour of the capcity function.
			<br/><br/>
			The implementation of the project is written in MATLAB, and its code is based 
			<a href="http://github.com/itamarr/symp-cap">here</a> (github).

	<span class="sec_title">Symplectic manifolds and symplectic capacities</span>
	<p>
		A <span class="defn">symplectic manifold</span> $(M,\om)$ is a smooth manifold $M$ equipped with a closed non-degenerate 2-form $\om$, called a symplectic form.
		A first example would be the standard symplectic vector space $\R^{2n}$, with coordinates $q_1, \ldots, q_n, p_1,\ldots, p_n$, equipped with the standard symplectic form $\om_0 = \sum_{i=1}^n dp_i \wedge dq_i$.
		Locally, by Darboux theorem, any symplectic manifold looks like the standard $(\R^{2n},\om_0)$. 
		Thus, there are no local invariants in symplectic geometry, as opposed to the situation in Riemannian geometry.
		However, numerical global invariants do exist, symplectic capacities are a significant example of such invariants.
		We deal with symplectic capacities of submanifolds of $\R ^{2n}$ equipped with the standard symplectic form, so will only describe this case.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We use the following notations:
		<ul>
			<li>
				$B_{2n}(r) = \{ x\in \R^{2n} \ |\  \|x\| < r \}$  the open ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin,
				and
			</li>
			<li>
				$Z_{2n}(r) = \{ x\in \R^{2n} : q_1^2 + p_1^2 < r^2 \} = B_2(r) \times \R^{2(n-1)}$, a cylinder.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
		<div class="definition">
			A <span class="defn">symplectic capacity</span> on $\R^{2n}$ is a function $c$ defined on open subsets of $\R^{2n}$, taking non-negative values, with the following properties:
			<ul class="numbered">
				<li>(Monotonicity) If $U \subset V$, then $c(U) \leq c(V)$, </li>
				<li>(Invariance) If $\vphi$ is a symplectomorphism, then $c(\vphi(U)) = c(U)$,</li>
				<li>(Homogeneity) For all $\alpha > 0$, $c(\alpha U) = \alpha^2 c(U)$,</li>
				<li>(Non-triviality) $c (B_{2n}(1)) > 0$ and $c(Z_{2n}(1)) < \infty$.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		A symplectic capacity $c$ is said to be <span class="defn">normalized</span>, if $c (B_{2n}(1)) = c(Z_{2n}(1)) = \pi $.
	<br/>
	
		It is a-priori unclear whether a symplectic capacity exists, but currently there is already a list of capacities introduced in various ways.
		The concept was introduced by I. Ekeland amd H. Hofer in 1990, although, in fact, the first symplectic capacity (the symplectic width) was constructed by M. Gromov, related to the Non-Squeezing theorem he proved in 1985.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The project focuses on a certain capacity, called the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity, $c_{EHZ}$.
		It is a normalized symplectic capacity defined on compact convex subsets of $\R^{2n}$, as will be shortly given.
		<br/>
		Let $K$ be a compact strictly convex set in $\R^{2n}$, such that $0$ is in the interior of $K$ and the boundary $\de K$ is smooth of class $C^2$.
		Denote $H(x) = \| x \|_K^2$, where $\| x \|_K = inf \{ \lambda>0 : x \in \lambda K \} $ is the semi-norm with respect to the convex body $K$.
		(It is a semi-norm in the sense that it is only positively homogeneous, since $K$ might not be symmetric; Being a semi-norm would be enough for our purposes). 
	
		By definition, $K = \{ x\in \R^{2n} : \|x\|_K \leq 1 \}$ and $\de K = H^{-1} (1)$.
		Note also that the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H = J \nabla H$ defines a flow on $\de K$.
		<br/>
		
		Consider the space of periodic orbits of $X_H$,
		\begin{equation}
  			\calE_K = \left\{ z \in C^2(\R,\de K) : \dot z = X_H\circ z,\ z(0)=z(T) \text{ for some }T>0\right\} \;.
  			\label{eq:def_space_of_periodic_orbits}
		\end{equation}
		
		<div class="definition">
			The <span class="defn">action</span> of an orbit $z \in \calE_K$ with period $T$ is
			$\calA (z) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^T \left<-J\dot z,z\right> dt \;.$
		</div>
		
		<div class="definition">
			The <span class="defn">Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity</span> of $K$ is the quantity
			\begin{equation}
				c_{EHZ} (K) = \inf \left\{  \calA (z) : z \in \calE _K  \right\} \;.
				\label{eq:def_EHZ_capacity}
			\end{equation}
		</div>
		
		We denote by $\calK$ the set of all compact strictly convex subsets of $\R^{2n}$ which have $C^2$ boundary.
		
		<div class="theorem">
		 	The functional $c_{EHZ}$ is a capacity on $\calK$.

		To establish a connection between capacities with the approach of Riemannian geometry, one can ask about the relations between capacity and volume. Some of these questions are in the taste of the isoperimetric inequality.
		
		<br/>
		Claude Viterbo has conjectured that among all convex bodies in $\R^{2n}$ of a given volume, the Euclidean ball has maximal symplectic capacity. 

		To be precise, consider the following relation between the a capacity $c$ of a (convex) set $K$ and the unit ball in $\R^{2n}$
		\begin{equation} 
			\frac{c(K)}{c\left( B_{2n} \right)} 
				\leq 
			\gamma_n \left( \frac{Vol (K) }{Vol (B_{2n})} \right) ^{1/n} \;,
			\label{viterbo_ineq_expression}
		\end{equation}
		
		where the constant $\gamma_n$ is of interest.
		
		
		
		<div class="conjecture"> (Viterbo's conjecture)
			The best constant in (\ref{viterbo_ineq_expression}) is $\gamma_n = 1$, for any choice of convex body $K$ and any capacity.
		</div>
		
		We considered this conjecture for the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity.
		<br/>
		
		Another known question is the following.
		<div class="conjecture"> (The subadditivity conjecture)
			If a convex body $K \subset \R^{2n}$ is covered by a finite set of convex bodies $\{ K_i \}$
			the for a symplectic capacity $c$, 
			\begin{equation}
				c(K) \leq \sum_i c(K_i) \;,
			\end{equation}
		</div>
		
		As part of the project, we tried to design and run tests of these famous conjectures. 
		Curious to see the results?? Check out the <a href="tests_results">tests &amp; results</a> section.
		
		<br/>
		
		Additionally, in the spirit of convex geometry, the following statement was suggested to be tested by Y. Ostrover.
		It is known that for any convex (symmetric?) body $K$, 
		<div class="conjecture">
			\begin{equation}
			
				c(K-K) \leq ???
			
			\end{equation}

	<span class="sec_title">Alice strikes again:</span>
	<p>
	
			It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
			
			However, this bottle was not marked `poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
			
			     *       *       *       *       *       *       *
			
			         *       *       *       *       *       *
			
			     *       *       *       *       *       *       *
			`What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up like a telescope.'
			And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
			
			After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
			
			`Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!'
			
			Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. `Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'
			
			She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.
			
			So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.
			
			     *       *       *       *       *       *       *
			
			         *       *       *       *       *       *
			
			     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

		The algorithm
	</h2>
	
	<p>
	Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
	There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.
